<h4 id="Basic">Basic C Langhuage</h4>
<p>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
    If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#,
    etc, as the syntax is similar
    C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
    C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies

<h4 id="For Loop">LOOP</h4>
<p>Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

    Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

    Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

    The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:</p>

<h4 id="Arry">Array</h4>
<p>Arrays have a great significance in the C language. They provide several advantages to the programmers while
    programming. Some of them are:

    Arrays make the code more optimized and clean since we can store multiple elements in a single array at once, so we
    do not have to write or initialize them multiple times.
    Every element can be traversed in an array using a single loop.
    Arrays make sorting much easier. Elements can be sorted by writing a few lines of code.
    Any array element can be accessed in any order either from the front or rear in O(1) time.
    Insertion or deletion of the elements can be done in linear complexity in an array.
    rrays have a great significance in the C language. They provide several advantages to the programmers while
    programming. Some of them are:

<h4 id="While Loop">loop</h4>
<p>The body of do...while loop is executed once. Only then, the testExpression is evaluated.
    If testExpression is true, the body of the loop is executed again and testExpression is evaluated once more.
    This process goes on until testExpression becomes false.
    If testExpression is false, the loop ends.</p>

<h4 id="If/Else">if</h4>
<p>The if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another
    block of code can be executed.

    The if/else statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different
    actions based on different conditions.
